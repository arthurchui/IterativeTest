Version 1.0.0 - (2008-01-04)
----------------------------

Initial release.
* Data-driven tests can be marked with the [IterativeTest] attribute. It can be used 
  to programmatically create a list of parameter values to be passed into a test. 
  The parameter to the IterativeTestAttribute constructor is a member that returns 
  an IEnumerable containing the objects to iterate over, calling the test with those 
  parameters.
* Not bullet proof, if you refer to a function that is not IEnumerable, or to a property
  the behavior is undefined.
* See IterativeTestSample.cs for an example of usage.
